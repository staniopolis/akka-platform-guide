= Increase SBR's decision process


include::partial$include.adoc[]

Deploying on Kubernetes opens the door to use Kubernetes provided mechanisms for decision making. The Akka {akka}/split-brain-resolver.html[Split-Brain Resolver {tab-icon}, window="tab"] can delegate on a Kubernetes-backed {akka-management}/kubernetes-lease.html[Lease {tab-icon}, window="tab"] the control over which half of a cluster may remain up during a split-brain scenario.

== Add the SBR and kubernetes lease dependencies

First make sure your application includes the SBR and the Kubernetes Lease dependencies on the build:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
.pom.xml:
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-java/pom.xml[tag=akka-sbr-kubernetes-lease]
----

Scala::
+
.build.sbt:
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-service-scala/build.sbt[tag=akka-sbr-kubernetes-lease]
----
